internet: 
    network of networks
    interconnected ISPs

    protocols everywhere
        sending/receiving messages

    standards:
        RFC: Request for Comments
        IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

Protocols:
    agreement between communicating peers on how to communicate
    peers: on the same layer level 
    communicates with other peers
        using protocol primitives such as GET, POST, HEAD

Service Primitives:
    service is formally specified by set of primitives (basic operations) available to users/entity 
    LISTEN, CONNECT, RECEIVE, SEND, DISCONNECT, GET, POST, etc.

    (if k+1 = application layer, k = TCP layer, k-1 = network layer)
    layer k+1 gets service provided by layer k, connects to a SAP (service access point)
    socket calls TCP service using primitives: SYN: server handshake, DATA: data, ACK: acknowledge, FIN: finish
    layer k supported by / uses layer k-1
    
5 Layers of Protocols
    different layers handle different procedures/tasks
    communication only occurs between the layers, doesnt skip around
    layer 1 communicates with physical medium at bottom 
    independence between layers
        services from lower levels provided to higher levels
        no need to specify how its implemented
    networks can have different functions/layers/content

    3 elements
        service: set of functions and tasks provided to a higher layer
        protocol: set rule used by layer to exhchange and transmit data
        interface: channel that allows for message transmission between layers

    every layer below the current one can be considered a "black box"
    when sending to layer below, each layer adds its own header
        based on immediate header, moves location

    Layer 5: 
        application layer
        communicates with peers called "HTTP" 
            using protocol primitives such as GET, POST, HEAD
        unit: message
    
    Layer 4:
        TCP process
        communicates with peers called TCP
        unit: segment

    Layer 3:
        IP, internet protocols
        where is the destination, how to reach the destination
        local tcp -> local computer -> local router -> another router -> ... -> server -> server tcp
        unit: datagram

    Layer 2:
        data link layer
        MAC â€” Mandatory Access Control
        Ethernet protocol
        only one device can talk to wifi at a given time
        who has right to transmit
        white area network
        unit: frame

    Layer 1: 
        physical layer

    Physical Medium

Connection Oriented vs Connectionless Services
    connection oriented: explictly set up connection, when done, explictly close connection 
        TCP connection
        remote login
    Connectionless: UDP connection, does not need to make a connection

Reliable Service vs Unreliable Service:
    reliable: sender will guarantee that receiver will get package
        ACK will be received
    unreliable: send message without guarantee for receiving package

OSI model (open system interconnection)
    also known as 7 layer model
    7 application, 6 presentation, 5 session, 4 transport, 3 network, 2 data link, 1 physical

TCP/IP model
    7 application, 4 transport, 3 internet, 2 1 host-to-network
    presentation/session not present here; dependent on application

Internet Architecture
    Tier 1 ISP: Largest coverage range; internet backbones
        AT&T, Sprint, etc
    Regional ISP
    Access ISP: last-mile ISP; direct access to users
